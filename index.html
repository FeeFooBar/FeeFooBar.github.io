              Is LeetCode a good indicator for SWE interviews?

            No and yes. No, it does not represent most of the day to day work.
            And yes, it represents sitting for long time in front of a screen
            thinking. And that is mostly what you are going to do in 'Big Tech'.<br/><br/>

            We as software engineers should appreciate that we have a clear
            recipe on how to do well in 'Big Tech' interviews.

            Firstly, who cares!<br/><br/>

            The frequency of which one get reminded of death increases with
            one's time on earth. Not because one is reminded of their own
            death, but because everyone around is getting older and closer to
            death.
